Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using a Linear Regression model. The dataset used in this project contains several attributes, including the furnishing status, area, number of bedrooms, and more, which influence the price of a house.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables. Categorical variables, such as furnishing status, are encoded into binary or dummy variables for use in the model.

Feature Selection and Target Variable: The target variable is the house price, while the features include attributes like area, number of bedrooms, and furnishing status.

Model Training: The data is split into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is then trained on the training data to predict the price of houses.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

Visualization: A bar plot compares the actual vs predicted prices for a sample of 20 test cases, visually demonstrating the performance of the model.

The results show how well the Linear Regression model can predict housing prices based on the provided features, helping us understand the model's accuracy and identify potential areas of improvement.

Objective:
The goal is to create a model that can make accurate predictions about house prices based on various input features. This project provides a foundational understanding of linear regression, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization in machine learning.
